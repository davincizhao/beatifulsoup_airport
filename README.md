The table with flight info has a table class="dataTDRight". Your task is to use 'process_file()' to extract the flight data from that table as a list of dictionaries, each dictionary containing relevant data from the file and table row. This is an example of the data structure you should return:  Note - year, month, and the flight data should be integers. You should skip the rows that contain the TOTAL data for a year.
